# Hello, random person on the internet!

I'm Matthew, a freshman in high school. I've been programming for more than three years.
I'm completely self taught, using online sites (mostly Youtube) to teach myself programming.
Hopefully it'll become my career one day!

On this Github page you can find several projects of mine, ranging from Python games using Pygame to C++ games using SDL2. I've been playing around with C++ for the past year, trying out OpenGL and SDL2, and have been using Python since I first started learning how to program.

If anyone finds this Github page, please feel free to leave constructive citizism in my code in order to help me improve!

Thanks for spending time checking out my Github page!
