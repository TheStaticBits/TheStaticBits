Hi there!

I'm Matthew, a current high school senior. I've been programming on and off as a hobby for roughly 5 years.
I'm completely self taught (besides of APCSP and APCSA), using websites like YouTube, StackOverflow, etc. to teach myself how to programming/code.
I've played around with Python (Pygame, Django), C++ (OpenGL, SDL), HTML/CSS/JS, and in the past, and Unity (though I didn't particularly like it).
More recently, I've been trying to improve my frontend web design skills in order to develop my own dynamic website where I can put up the little games I make.
I've been learning the basics of React (with Next.js), along with Typescript and Tailwind CSS, and it's been lots of fun so far!

Check out the website I'm building with Next.js & Tailwind, using Supabase and Vercel, at https://ofstatic.com!
Having lots of fun with it so far, but many pages are not implemented yet.
