Hi there!

I'm Matthew, a current high school junior. I've been programming on and off as a hobby for over 4 years (since April 2019).
I'm completely self taught, using websites like YouTube, StackOverflow, etc. to teach myself how to programming/code.
I've played around with Python (Pygame, Django), C++ (OpenGL, SDL), HTML/CSS/JS, and in the past, Unity (though I didn't particularly like it).
More recently, I've been trying to improve my frontend web design skills in order to develop my own dynamic website where I can put up the little games I make.
I've been learning the basics of React (with Next.js), along with Typescript and Tailwind CSS, and it's been lots of fun so far!

I still have a ton of space to improve, and I'm looking forward to learning more as I go!
